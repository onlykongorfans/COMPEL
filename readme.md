## Overview

COMPEL is a cross-platform, Native-AOT ASP.NET Core application that launches and supervises Heroes Of Newerth match servers on a host machine. Some of its functions are the following:

- synchronises the match server distribution from the CDN (incremental, hash-verified, atomic) into its own directory, then launches and supervises the Heroes Of Newerth manager process, restarting it if it exits unexpectedly
- runs a managed, cross-platform UDP proxy when enabled, forwarding the public game and voice ports to the local server ports and authenticating clients with the challenge protocol they require on that port range
- answers the master server's UDP latency pings
- exposes an HTTP control plane so it can be pinged for latency, queried by the master server, and managed remotely by the host operator

It ships as a single self-contained binary plus a self-describing `COMPEL.json`. The match server distribution is synchronised into the same directory as the executable.

## Configuration

All host-facing configuration lives in a single `COMPEL.json` beside the executable, in the self-documenting `{ "Value": …, "Description": … }` format. On first run it is generated with defaults and descriptions, and COMPEL stops so it can be edited. Every value is validated at startup, and all startup problems are reported together.

| Key                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserName` / `Password` | The Project KONGOR host account credentials.                                                                                                                                 |
| `Instances`             | Number of match server instances (1 … logical processor count).                                                                                                              |
| `Gateway`               | Address advertised by the match servers: `localhost`, `PUBLIC` (auto-detect public IP), an IPv4 address, or a host name.                                                    |
| `MasterServer`          | Master server endpoint used for authentication and registration, such as `api.kongor.net` or `192.168.0.186:5555`.                                                          |
| `Location`              | TMM region: `USW`, `USE`, `EU`, `AU`, `BR`, `RU`, `SEA`, or `NEWERTH`.                                                                                                       |
| `ServerNamePrefix`      | The base match server name. The instance index is appended.                                                                                                                  |
| `UseProxy`              | Whether to run the proxy (public port remapping + client challenge authentication. Defaults to `true`).                                                                      |
| `PortRangeOffset`       | Offset into the game/voice port windows. `base + offset + instances` must stay within the 100-port window.                                                                   |
| `RuntimeArtefactsPath`  | `DEFAULT` (the host account's profile) or a fully qualified path. Windows only, as the runtime artefacts path is hard-coded for the Linux server distribution.               |
| `CDNHost`               | Base URL containing the `las` and `was` match-server distributions. This must be set explicitly.                                                                            |
| `CDNSynchronisation`    | Whether to synchronise the distribution from the CDN on startup. Set `false` to skip the initial synchronisation for development/testing (the `/sync` endpoint still works). |
| `AuthenticationToken`   | Bearer token gating the management endpoints. Leave as `...` to disable remote management.                                                                                   |
| `ControlPlanePort`      | TCP port for the HTTP control plane (default `8080`).                                                                                                                        |

## Running

```
dotnet run --project source/COMPEL
```

On first run COMPEL writes a default `COMPEL.json` next to the executable and exits. Set `UserName`, `Password`, and `CDNHost`; set `Gateway` to the address clients use for the match-server host and `MasterServer` to the NEXUS master-server endpoint. Set `AuthenticationToken` to enable remote management. Logs are written to the console and to a single `COMPEL.log` beside the executable.

| `GET`  | `/status`                                                   | bearer         | Configuration, ports, distribution version, sync state, manager/proxy state, uptime. |
| `POST` | `/sync`                                                     | bearer         | Trigger a CDN re-synchronisation.                                                    |
| `POST` | `/instances/start`, `/instances/stop`, `/instances/restart` | bearer         | Manage match server lifecycles.                                                      |

Authenticate management requests with `Authorization: Bearer <AuthenticationToken>`, using the `AuthenticationToken` from `COMPEL.json`.

## Building & Publishing

Requires the .NET 10 SDK. A native, self-contained release is produced per platform via the publish profiles, or locally with the helper script (PowerShell 7+; on Windows, the Visual Studio C++ build tools are required for the Native AOT link step):

```
pwsh scripts/Publish-Native-AOT-Release.ps1
```

Tagged pushes (`vX.Y.Z`) trigger `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml`, which builds all four platform targets (Windows and Linux, each × x64 and arm64) and attaches one zip per platform to a single GitHub Release.

## Testing

```
dotnet test --solution source/COMPEL.slnx
```

The `COMPEL.Tests` project (TUnit) covers the port arithmetic, manager arguments, configuration validation and loading, the ping and proxy-challenge wire formats, and the proxy relay over loopback. The `global.json` at the repository root selects the Microsoft Testing Platform runner that TUnit requires. `.github/workflows/run-unit-tests.yml` runs the suite on Windows and Linux for every pull request to `main`.

## Solution Layout

```
scripts/    Native AOT release helper
source/     COMPEL.slnx, Directory.Build.props/.targets, .editorconfig, the COMPEL project, and the COMPEL.Tests project
```
