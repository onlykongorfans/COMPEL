///     The managed, cross-platform proxy. When enabled, it runs a UDP relay per instance for both the game and voice ports, forwarding the public ports (offset by <see cref="PortPlan.ProxyPublicOffset"/>) to the local server ports.
///     Heroes Of Newerth clients throttle their own traffic on the public port range until the proxy authenticates them, so each forwarder issues a challenge to every session on creation and this service renews those challenges periodically.
/// </summary>
// TODO: This proxy performs the transport, port remapping, and client authentication only. It does NOT detect cheaters or ban anyone: the native proxy's detection heuristics lived in a closed binary and are not reproduced, and the previous firewall/ban-list mechanism was removed as ineffective. A future redesign is expected to introduce a different enforcement approach (likely not a static ban list), at which point a hook to drop or block traffic per source can be reintroduced.
