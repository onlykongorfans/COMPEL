    public string Description => "The password of the user which will host the game servers. This needs to match the password of the registered Project KONGOR user set to host the game servers.";

{
    public int Value { get; set; } = 1;
    public string Description => "The number of server instances to spawn. This must be between one and the number of logical processors. The server manager spreads the instances across the available processors; running COMPEL with elevated privileges is required for the manager to assign their processor affinity.";
}

public sealed class IdleTargetSetting
{
    public int Value { get; set; } = 1;
    public string Description => "The number of configured instances CowMaster should keep IDLE and immediately selectable. The remaining instances stay SLEEPING until demand wakes them. This must be between zero and Instances.";
}

public sealed class GatewaySetting
{
    public string Value { get; set; } = "kongor.net";
    public string Description => "The IPv4 address advertised by the game servers and server manager. Use 'PUBLIC' to detect the host's public address, 'localhost' for same-machine development, a LAN or public IPv4 address, or a host name to resolve.";
}

{
    public string Value { get; set; } = "api.kongor.net";
    public string Description => "The master server endpoint used to authenticate and register the server manager and game servers. Include the port when the master server does not use its default port, for example '192.168.0.186:5555'.";

    public string Description => "Whether to run COMPEL's built-in proxy in front of the game servers. When enabled, clients connect through the public 20000+ range (e.g. the registered endpoint 21234 is relayed to the first game socket on 11235); the proxy forwards them to the servers and authenticates each client with the challenge protocol required on that port range. Set to 'false' to use the direct 10000+ endpoints.";

    public string Description => "The base directory beneath which the match server writes its runtime artefacts (e.g. replays, logs). This value is either the 'DEFAULT' alias, which places artefacts beneath the host account's profile (its 'Documents/Heroes of Newerth x64' tree, where everything else is written), or a fully qualified path to use as the base profile directory instead. This setting applies on Windows only; the Linux server build writes to a fixed location ('/opt/hon/config') and ignores it.";

{
    public bool Value { get; set; } = true;
    public string Description => "Whether to synchronise the match server distribution from the CDN on startup. Set to 'false' to skip the initial synchronisation for development and testing, in which case the existing local distribution is used; the '/sync' management endpoint can still trigger a synchronisation on demand.";
}

public sealed class CDNHostSetting
{
    public string Value { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Description => "The base URL of the CDN containing the per-platform match server distributions. This must be configured explicitly; COMPEL appends 'las/manifest.json' on Linux or 'was/manifest.json' on Windows.";

{
    public string Value { get; set; } = "...";
    public string Description => "The bearer token that NEXUS and host operators must present to use the remote management endpoints (status, synchronisation, and instance lifecycle). Leave as '...' (or empty) to disable remote management. The control plane serves plain HTTP, so expose it only on a trusted network or behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy; otherwise the token travels in cleartext.";
}

{
